## Introduction to Econometrics (UN3412)

This is the repository containing the files used to create the TeX files for the recitation notes and the lecture slides for the Introduction to Econometrics (UN3412) class in Spring 2021 semester. I used to post the recitation notes before the class and the lectures slides after. Please contact me (sl4436@columbia.edu) or send a pull request if you spot any errors.

### Recitation Notes
